## Architecture Overview

### Core Concepts
- **Something:** Any capture from reality (photo, note, video, etc.).
- **Why:** First-class somethings themselves, representing why a capture matters. Connected via relationships.
- **Abode:** A collection of somethings (and/or whys), can be nested into higher-level abodes.
- **Filter:** Operates on abodes to reveal patterns, connections, and highlights across the system.
- **Meta-Abode:** Highest-level abode containing all other abodes; represents your life.
- **Unknowns:** Areas of exploration outside current understanding.

### Controller vs. Game
- **Controller:** The underlying system; the spaceship/home base. Organizes somethings, whys, abodes, filters, unknowns. 
- **Game Layer:** A layer on top that adds missions, guided abodes, visual skins, or challenges. Uses the controller’s data but adds gameplay mechanics for learning, reflection, or fun.

### Whys and Filters
- Whys are first-class somethings; they are **reusable**, connect multiple captures, and provide the paths for pattern recognition.
- Filters highlight somethings by whys, across abodes, showing patterns and emergent connections.
- Focused abodes (e.g., Beauty, Ugly, Dreams) make filters especially powerful and reflective of inner life.
- Over time, whys **improve in quality**, often from obvious human insights, and motivation ensures users actively fill and evolve their reality.

### Abodes vs. Metadata
- Using abodes for filters keeps the system **clean and scalable**.
- Metadata alone can be messy; abodes provide structured relationships between captures and whys.
- Nested abodes allow patterns to emerge naturally and enable AI predictions or suggestions.

### Potential Flaws and Mitigations
1. **Complexity:** Start simple; grow layers over time.
2. **Subjectivity:** Offer optional standardized whys while preserving personal ones.
3. **Filter effectiveness:** Use AI or prompts to suggest clusters or missing whys.
4. **Unknowns:** Exploratory modes and AI guidance for new areas.
5. **Scalability:** Lazy loading, collapsing low-priority abodes, abstracting layers.
6. **Ambiguity in relationships:** Allow multiple parent abodes with clear inheritance rules.
7. **User adoption:** Gamification, AI prompts, low-friction capture.
8. **Visualization challenges:** Start 2D with optional expansion.
9. **Dependency on whys:** Support users with examples, AI suggestions, and prompts.

### Heart-Focused Game Alignment
- Focused abodes (Beauty, Ugly, Dreams) make this system ideal for a game about finding your heart.
- Filters act as compasses to navigate inner reality.
- Deep reflection uncovers patterns in somethings and whys, revealing personal insights.
- Expandable nesting allows more complex exploration while maintaining the core model.
- Controller layer ensures consistent navigation and organization; game layer adds guided missions, visual storytelling, and player engagement.

### Insight
> This system externalizes life’s meaning and patterns into a navigable architecture. Users uncover their why, discover passions, and reflect on their inner life through structured somethings, whys, and abodes. Filters act as lenses, the controller is the spaceship, and the game layer is the journey. Motivation and reflection ensure growth and deeper understanding over time.
