## Raw Consciousness Streams - ur "reality"

### Stream 1
ok so lets do incremental mode. but let me tell you where we going to change course towards. the trigger: 2.10 where we are connecting the physical and mental realms was the impetus for realizing our current organization doesn't make sense
also for later purposes double check we have chat feature on website with friends. and the chat should add meaning to and ping parts of your reality.
also for capture we need to add scanning hand writing from pictures so if theres a journal pic it should be able to parse hand writing into paragraphs, and remember it should only split on new line not paragraphs so ya.
ok now that those are out of the way. we are going to not just change but implement the MVP cohesive organization of the entire web app now. i want all of this info documented as the main organization and shape of the prd and to influence everything. this will be a way to shape and form everything we have and will work on so far into a presentable form. it will also influence our goals moving forward and help simplify our goals. separately i want this whole chunk that i'm going to type to be outputted into a separate markdown file called: ur_"reality". actually do that now so i can type it there with the below info

let's understand the UX. what happens is the user, in physical reality, has an experience whatever it is and decides to capture it, because its important it has meaning, it is SOMEthing. The supported methods of capture for us are hand-written text(images uploaded to our system, or files/pdfs of it), images(just photos), typed text(like in apple notes, imsgs), pdfs/epubs, links(of ig, tiktok

### Stream 2
ok so i like typing here for the dopamine hit so i want u to organize things to markdown file as we go, ok. here's whats going to happen so forget capture methods talked about earlier, what i'm going to do is do a little streams of consciousness. i want you to, including the last prompt i typed above, save the bursts of consciousness into a separate txt file, separated like 1, 2, 3, ...  and then i want u to organize everything by adding to the markdown file and then before reading my next prompt i want u to look at the markdown file to see how i changed things. that should become ur current reality ok, so like essentially loading context in. so then i'm assuming u are upto date with the markdown file not my previous prompt i want u to basically forget what i wrote before. so we have covered supported types of capture, its a combination of inputting on our page and uploading previously captured(like a photo took earlier, etc.) media.

so ok now whatever captured has entered the user's reality. so its a something. we can assume the user cares about that something otherwise they wouldn't have captured it. so in the same way how we are doing it currently, the user can captur
https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/turn-any-website-into-full-screen-app-your-iphone-0384426/fffe to their heart's content, lets say for days in a row, weeks in a row etc. we will call this explorer mode, where the user is just exploring reality discovering and capturing meaning, in an unbounded fashion. so this is why the capture page can't redirect, it also shouldn't display a green capture sent it should just be sent to db so that user can proceed with next capture without being distracted. so capture page should be wholly black almost exactly like apple notes, with the default capture method being text, and pretty big font size. i want u to save and look into this for how we can simulate mobile experience of an app just using website for later: https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/turn-any-website-into-full-screen-app-your-iphone-0384426/
 but the major point is that the capture page should be ridiculously plain with text capture at top, it shouldn't even have an insert text here page . at the bottom, centered, there should be a microphone button for the purpose of recording audio, also black but different shade, white microphone icon and simulate a 3D extruded button. and when pressed and held down u can talk to it. when double clicked it just records until it is clicked again. when double clicked it should just look pressed down and turn dark red with white square in middle. when empty text space is double clicked and held it should open file upload page and then once media is uploaded the page should disappear, like nothing happened and return back to capture page, to allow user to once again in a undistracted manner capture whatever they need to next, with the confidence that their file uploaded. so those are the two pages so far, the "live-capture" page for recording, typing in the moment. and when this page is double clicked and held, the page should sink-transition(idk how to implement thiss, point to discuss later after implementation of both pages)into the "file-capture" page. this page includes links, photos, videos, images of hand-written text, audio, and any other miscellaneous files we decide to support in later releases. so that should cover all of capture functionality and implementation. feel free to edit existing text on markdown file to fit however best makes sense of everything holistically. ask me if anything isn't crystal clear for implementation.

### Stream 3 - Implementation Clarity Answers
1) live capture should ripple away slowly it shouldn't be immediate cuz then the illusion of the capture page being solid should be believed. but we can play around with it, but remember its gotta be double clicked and held.
2) max recording length should just be whatever is free, not too complicated for mvp making i want it eventually infinite
3) file upload, should just work, nothing too big but regular iphone images and videos should fit and voice memos files. the only progress indication should be the images almost zooming away like when file is u k first uploaded by user to the file-capture page it is held, then when user decides to send it to their reality it should just zoom away the files, it'd be cool if the files gave the illusion of zooming into a corner, and then it should be replaced by live-capture page after that is over.
4) yes auto-save behavior, if user navigates away mid-type it should stil be there when they return.

### Stream 4 - Direction & Chamber Philosophy
ok hol up. first stop calling it (ur "reality"), that's not it, its (ur "reality") idk if imma keep the brackets, but for now that's the branding with the quotations and the parentheses. the point being we want to maintain a bit of a sarcastic tone so that people don't get too serious about it, it is supposed to be playful otherwise people will war over it too much, already they prolly will but the idea is to keep it light.

ok so to figure out how to store somethings that is to figure out how to change something's db in a correct way, it's best to probably think about what we are going to do with the somethings. Otherwise it's just a giant mess. It's good that we have changed capture table to somethings. Having a captures table was a bad idea initially.

So i'm going to talk into the future, what we are going to do with the somethings we got. and probably its best to not overwhelm dev with a huge story so lets figure out how to phase it out and make a new epic. The beauty is because we didn't make a separate epic or architecture or prd doc and are creating step by step and building as we go, we can just archive what we were going to do (which doesn't really exist anyway, only as an idea) and we can easily change direction without losing anything major. just we need to be sure to incorporate existing information so we don't lose anything or try to rederive anything from scratch.

but ok back to present. I'm going to continue my stream of consciousness in the next prompt, but hopefully that sets the table for what we are going to do. Do whatever setup you need to do and i'll begin writing the next phase past the capture pages.

so now you have something in our reality. this is where the game begins... why? because sure you cared about something, now what are you going to do about it? what's the point about caring about something, if you don't express your care. whats the point of trashing your chamber? Without organizing it, clearing it off cobwebs and using the meaning you've collected to create something beautiful. there's no point caring about everything, if your going to do nothing about it. And thats the other thing because of DEATH you simply can't care about everything, and even worse you can only care and express your care for a small amount of somethings(hint hint thats ur "reality) sometimes the answer is nothing to do right now and u'll figure out what to do in the future. but most times, theres something you can do about it. even if its putting that something in the bigger context of your everything, your reality, even if thats connecting that something to a prior everything we are going to reimagine the UX from the previous chamber tho. we have entered and will continue a bit of philosophical discussion first so we know the actions a user will take in the chamber and how it will be useful i wrote it elsewhere which is why its weird but thats the end of stream 4.

### Stream 5 - Core Philosophy: Not Frameworks, Just What You Want

so i've thought extensively about this, what is the framework to answer the question what do about something but it must be stressed here that the answer is not a framework, its to do what you want. thats the core of it. What we are building is a tool of tools to help you do what you want, like trying to make a roblox studio but for real life. so what we are making is a tool of tools. and fundamentally this is currently limited to what i want. that's all i know. but i want a lot so imma start there, get people to use it and then help me build out and flesh out the tool. the tool that helps you, no addicts you, to doing what you want.

Here & now, this is what I want. I am just a kid.

First, why capture something in the first place? because it matters more than the moment had space for it, it matters more than you had the ability to express in the moment. you capture something because you cared about something. why did you care? I don't know, there could plenty of reasons, perhaps something reminded you of a previous experience, maybe a previous experience caused you to dislike/like something without you even realizing why, maybe because u found beauty in something, maybe because u found ugly in something, maybe because you found a desire, a deep-seated dream in something, maybe you cared about something because you are just human.

and that's the beauty the meaning of something could be infinitely layered, there's not always a logical reason you care about something. the important part tho is that you do. and that's the point we are trying to get across. you can infinitely question why you care, but it all rests on the fact that you do, in fact care. and that's the philosophical backing, something. something you care about. and from there, you can do anything you want about anything.

but here's the catch, you can care limitlessly... as long as you have life. and you have ? amt of life. unknown, but finite. so you only have ? amt of time to care and more importantly express your care. so its important what you care about, what you choose to care about in the next moment, and most important what your going to do about something. here's what I propose:

It's not enough to just leave expression of care to chance. I want more. More what? Beauty.

because caring isn't binary its a spectrum from the darkest dark to the brightest light. I also don't really know the cause of it, it seems to be an infinitely mysterious concept. Why? Because you can always ask why. I like chocolate. Why? Because its sweet and rich flavored. Why do you like sweet and richly flavored things? I don't know. That's a silly example, but its the same with a lot of much more important things. It's bad to kill people. Why? Because they deserve to have a full life time. Why? Because it is a gift to be here. Why? I care for something.

So I want to spend my life finding all the things I care about, all the ways I can express my care, how I can make reality(here) more beautiful, transform the ugly. Why? Because I'm not alone here, if I was alone then maybe it'd make sense to just experience reality as is. But there's a whole sea of those with life around me, other someones. and theres more and more coming fresh off the boat, given new life. The Kids. and if we, as human beings, can do something about what we care about, I believe its our responsibility to make Our Reality as Beauty-Full as can be.  So how?

My main and only real source of information about beauty and ugly, in this sea of unknown I find myself in is from my ability to care. I am going to call it my heart because that's where I feel it when I REALLY care, but its commonly used as the indicator of care. so its going to be my compass.

 then when I find something I care about, the first that matters is what am I going to do about it. Sometimes I just act unconsciously like dancing to music I like, or reacting to a jumpscare in a horror movie, intuitive discoveries, sensing I care before I really *know*. vibing. playing. feeling something.

this is the easiest way to play the game, and I do wanna maximize play: catching a vibe, riding with it, j vibing. I am always trying to elevate the vibe, but just as I care for a high vibe, I also care when my experience is less, much less pleasant, when the vibe is low, at rock bottom, I also care for these moments. for organization: I'm going to call feeling a high vibe beauty, and feeling a low vibe ugly. my heart helps me find beauty and ugly. obviously vibes are felt as emotions just another word, but in my reality i'm going to call it vibez cuz it feels less permanent.

ok got slightly off topic but essentially all of that was to say I can care about something on a spectrum of lowest of lowest vibes and highest of highest. the goal is to elevate the vibe, high vibes are beautiful, low vibes are ugly. and sometimes i can act unconsciously, do something without knowing I'm doing something. that's like easy mode. but i often have the ability to choose to do something.

so the question becomes i care about something, how do I choose what to do about? doing what I want, if I unconsciously act and this unconscious action is what i want, provides me the result of what I want is easy, but what about if i'm just aware of something and don't really know how to react to it. also acting unconsciously isn't always what I want, I don't want to just get upset everytime because someone yells at me, I want to be able to curate my experience with learnings, prior knowledge, so that my reality gets more beautiful with time and evolves to have a higher vibe. I need more information about every thing. Its no fun to just unconsciously act, without even knowing what I'm doing, that is no more than being an animal of the dumbest kind. In fact unconsciously acting might just be being dumb, at times, although no doubt it does help at times. My ability to choose what to do is an integral aspect of my power, and gives me many more dimensions to understand of both myself and reality. I have the ability to do whatever I want, not just in an unconscious sense, but in the sense I can choose what to want itself, infinitely scaling.

so I need to find what I want, the same way I'm aware of something, I need to become aware of what to do about it, what I want to do with it. How?

Firstly, I need more information in general, i need to be aware of more. If I'm not expanding my awareness then I'm not increasing the amount of potential somethings I want, care about etc. I also have less of a bigger context to fit things into. Then when I care about something, I want to get more information about something. So it'd help to know why i care about something. It'd also help to know what something is and use what I already know of other things to map something with more context and in relation to what I already know to further color it in. Essentially put something in my map of meaning, to place it in the bigger context of my journey and to come up with good explanations for what something is, gives me more awareness of the nature of something, including the nature of my own heart and how things behave over time, why they behave in a certain way, and more. then of course with all my information is the ability to do something, that's key in changing my reality, because no amount of understanding changes reality. so just like i'm increasing how much I know, I need to increase my ability to do something, track what I can't do, track what I can, prioritize which abilities to work on and turn weaknesses into strengths. so currently the logic is I care about something, I can act unconsciously do what I want but that doesn't always beautify my reality so in that case I use my ability to choose to do something, but my choice is limited by how much I know and my ability to do something.

ok stream is over i need some help tying this to chamber now and app in general can u suggest direction to go. like essentially i guess the point is when you don't know what to do you head back to your reality and see what else you can discover in what you know already in a sense like make connections, dreams to pursue, goals to organize, etc. like its a thinking aid in a sense, helps you choose what you want to do.

[Stream 5 complete - awaiting direction discussion]

### Stream 6 - Reality vs. My Reality: The Dual Structure

so ok theres two aspects, there's my reality, which is what i know. but then the inarguable sorta part u have to live in and start from is reality, where we are human. that the playfield that matters.  sure we can go endlessly about being just someone in my reality etc. etc. but all of that is simply to help our human experience, reality. reality is being human, thats where it starts that's where you live thats where others are, thats where u can connect with people, other humans etc. all this computer etc. is just to figure out your intention but after you do so the point is to return to reality, being human. how does one be human? simply by returning to the realms of human senses, the realm of touch, the realm of smell, the realm of taste, the realm of sound, the realm of sight, and the realm of feeling. and the combination of these is our reality. now, our reality mightn't be and probably isn't truth, isn't what exists, but that's not what matters most. sure, water is made of billions of tiny little cells and knowing that helps give us more awareness, and hence more control, and ideas on what we can do about it, but its second to the fact that we need water to be healthy and live a long life, its second to the experience of drinking water. and thats what we are trying to do here, we are trying to fundamentally use our experiences in reality to help enhance our realm of thought, which's whole purpose is to direct ourselves through reality in a way that optimally creates our future. that's the point to understand ones intentions and help curate them. the reason we capture somethings is because we are a student of ourselves, the reason most people nowaday's don't really is because they think they are stuck in reality, no if your reality sucks there's no point to keep on living the same life without changing anything, you can use your realm of thought, upgrade it and use it to set your intentions. i don't know if its useful for other things but we will find out. your realm of thought is your reality, but reality is what its built off of. so we almost gotta make this ur reality that we are building queryable with intention. like u have all these somethings, but you need to decide what your intention is to actually access it, but when someone figures it out, their intention that is and the llm that lives in your reality gets that command, then you are able to connect mroe somethings.

the point of your reality is to make your reality more beautiful thats all. the reason u enter your reality is because you want to solve something, or you want to create something, its not just liike useless, the point is we need a chamber of reflection to figure out and align our many human drives in accordance with reality and know what we want so that we can act accordingly

become a student of you and your reality

we are trying to help people discover their best game thats the point. like you gotta figure out what is your game that you are playing

it simplifies everything, cuz we start from the globe now and it makes sense to. thats reality.

we need to help people build their inner story. the inner story is whats going on in ur head right, but the point is u can write it, by reflecting about it and thats part of hte point. to figure out who you are. its sooooo deep because all u are is someone, but someone is ALL YOU ARE, and do you know someone

geolocation is free

caring shows you have heart. thats what proves your human. when you care. thats why beauty, ugly matters because its the foundation bruh of who you are. from there, you can decide who you want to steer ur intention and knowing the why, going deeper per say into your heart is possible. like initially u might just care about lUST LUST LUST, but with deeper reflection you realize the reason why lust is a thing, and how it results in ugly, and then u can course correct. like it might feel beauty at the moment right like with lust it looks like it will create more beauty at the moment, but then it actually doesn't so then u ask yourself is this what i want. and this reflection is what it means to study yourself and your reality. THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

the game hasn't begun until you set a goal. then ur rocket ship, in your reality should start moving. i'm not sure exactly how but essentially that's when you depart from reality and start collecting relevant somethings etc. and essentially your reality will become colored by this intention and align to this goal. that's when our tool will shine, with intentions and you can have a hierarchy of intentions, of dreams you are headed towards. and thats when the ship(representative of your attention leaves the globe of reality and goes into your realm of somethings, and brings to forefront the relevant question marks. revealing the question marks in a sense
