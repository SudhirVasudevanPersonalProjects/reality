# Review notes
notes: |
  This is an excellent foundational setup that provides a clean base for future development.

  Key strengths:
  - TypeScript strict mode enforces type safety from the start
  - Proper Supabase SSR implementation with browser/server separation
  - Clean monochromatic "void" theme (#1a1f2e) matching design vision
  - Minimal, focused dependencies
  - Production deployment successful with environment variables configured

  The implementation is production-ready for an initialization story. Testing was appropriately
  waived as stated in story requirements. All 6 acceptance criteria are met and verified.

  No refactoring or improvements needed. Ready to proceed to next story.
