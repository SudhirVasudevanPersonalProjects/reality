  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling with 404/401/500 responses, graceful empty states, cascade delete for referential integrity"
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "TypeScript typing could be improved (several 'any' types in MindCard component). Code is otherwise clean and well-structured."
