schema: 1
story: "2.1"
story_title: "Database Schema Evolution - Three Realms Foundation"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Comprehensive database migration successfully implemented with excellent test coverage (12/12 passing), proper RLS policies, performance indexes, and type safety. Build succeeds, all acceptance criteria met."

# Quality Assessment

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "RLS policies properly implemented with auth.uid() checks. Explicit schema qualification prevents namespace issues. SECURITY DEFINER functions use public. prefix safely."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive index strategy including partial indexes with WHERE clauses. GIST index for spatial queries. All queries expected < 150ms for 1K records."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "CASCADE deletes properly configured. Triggers use explicit schema paths. Data migration preserves all existing captures. Constraints enforce data integrity."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation via SQL comments on all tables/columns/functions. Clear separation of concerns (base + extension tables). TypeScript types auto-generated. Migration organized into logical sections."

# Technical Excellence Highlights
highlights:
  - "669-line migration organized into 8 clear sections with comprehensive comments"
  - "Explicit public. schema qualification prevents subtle namespace bugs"
  - "Smart trigger design: seed_default_domains fires after handle_new_user completes"
  - "Proper type conflict resolution (careData vs care field)"
  - "Zod schemas use correct z.record(string, unknown) syntax for JSONB validation"
  - "Application code updated consistently (API routes, dashboard, types)"
  - "Build succeeds with zero errors or warnings"

# Test Architecture Assessment
test_quality:
  strengths:
    - "12/12 schema tests passing - comprehensive coverage"
    - "Tests validate constraints (CHECK, FK, UNIQUE)"
    - "Tests verify triggers (updated_at, full_path computation, domain seeding)"
    - "Tests check cascade deletes and RLS policies via schema validation"
    - "Performance test validates auto-update trigger with sleep"
  areas_for_improvement:
    - "RLS test suite requires email confirmation setup (documented as known limitation)"
  overall_assessment: "Excellent test coverage for database schema evolution"
