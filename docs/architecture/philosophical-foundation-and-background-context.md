# 2. Philosophical Foundation & Background Context

## 1: What Reality Is

Reality is not a productivity app, a diary, or a memory tool - it is a **meaning-making engine** designed to help you understand and solve your own mind by mapping the infinite web of connections between what you've experienced, what you think, and what you want.

**The Core Insight:** Your mind is not a linear story. It's a network of interconnected experiences, thoughts, and desires that constantly feed into each other in loops. Understanding your mind means **making these connections explicit**.

## 2: The Three Temporal Dimensions

Every human reality operates across three temporal dimensions:

1. **Past (Experience)** - What happened. The events you lived through, captured moments, memories.
2. **Present (Thought)** - What you think about it now. Your reflections, interpretations, sense-making.
3. **Future (Desire)** - What you want. Your aspirations, goals, motivations, unfulfilled wishes.

Most tools capture only one dimension:
- Journals capture Experiences (past)
- Note-taking apps capture Thoughts (present)
- Todo apps capture Desires (future, but reduced to tasks)

**Reality captures all three AND the connections between them.**

## 3: Why Connections Are The Point

Understanding your mind is not about:
- Capturing more experiences (hoarding memories)
- Writing more thoughts (journaling for its own sake)
- Listing more desires (endless todo lists)

**Understanding your mind is about mapping the relationships:**
- Why do I want this? (Desire → Thought connection: exploring motivation)
- What caused me to think this way? (Experience → Thought connection: causality)
- Did this fulfill what I wanted? (Experience → Desire connection: completion)
- What does this remind me of? (Experience → Experience connection: pattern recognition)
- How do my thoughts reveal hidden desires? (Thought → Desire connection: self-discovery)

**Every connection you create makes implicit relationships explicit.** This is how you:
- Understand recurring patterns in your life
- See how past experiences shape current desires
- Recognize what truly matters vs what you thought mattered
- Build wisdom from lived experience
- Solve the puzzle of your own mind

## 4: The Infinite Loop: Desire → Thought → Action → Experience → Thought → Desire

Human experience operates in an infinite self-reinforcing loop:

```
You DESIRE something
   ↓
You THINK about how to get it (planning, strategizing)
   ↓
You ACT in the physical world (acting is the bridge - not captured in system)
   ↓
You EXPERIENCE the result (what actually happened)
   ↓
You THINK about what it meant (reflection, interpretation)
   ↓
This generates new DESIRES based on what you learned
   ↓
[LOOP CONTINUES]
```

**Acting is in the middle, but it's for the body, not the mind.** Reality is designed to solve the mind by capturing the mental states (Desire/Thought) and lived outcomes (Experience) - the acting happens in physical reality between these states.

**Example Loop:**
- Desire: "I want to reconnect with family" → Thought: "I should call Mom weekly" → Action: [makes phone calls] → Experience: "Had deep conversation with Mom about her childhood" → Thought: "I never knew she struggled with this. We're more alike than I realized." → New Desire: "Understand my family history better" → [loop continues]

## 5: Capture First, Meaning Later

A critical architectural principle: **All fields are nullable (except core IDs). Meaning is added over time.**

When you capture an Experience via SMS:
- You don't categorize it (category = null → defaults to "abode" inbox)
- You don't rate its quality (qualityScore = null, qualityNumber = null)
- You don't add location names or tags (all nullable)
- You just capture the raw moment

**Meaning-making happens later** when you:
- Organize experiences into Heart/Mind/Body/Soul categories
- Rate emotional quality (1-10) and aesthetic quality (1-10)
- Add thoughts reflecting on the experience
- Create connections to other experiences, thoughts, desires
- Tag with your personal vocabulary

**This design eliminates friction at capture time** while enabling infinite depth during reflection time. The architecture optimizes for both speed (capture) and richness (meaning-making).

## 6: Maximum Freedom, Minimal Constraints

The architecture is designed to **get out of your way**:

**User-Extensible Vocabularies:**
- Experience categories start as Heart/Mind/Body/Soul/Abode but you can create your own
- Thought types start as reflection/question/insight but you can create your own
- Connection relationship types have defaults but you define your own vocabulary
- Tags are completely freeform - your personal language

**Universal Connections:**
- ANY entity can connect to ANY other entity (Experience↔Thought, Desire↔Experience, Thought↔Desire, etc.)
- No system-imposed limits on what can relate to what
- Meaning lives in the connection (the "why" field), not just the entities

**This is intentionally messy** because reality is messy. The system provides structure (entities, relationships, attributes) but doesn't impose meaning - **you create the meaning through connections**.

## 7: Solving The Mind

The ultimate goal of Reality is to help you **solve your own mind** by:

1. **Externalizing the network** - Getting the web of experiences/thoughts/desires out of your head and into a mappable system
2. **Making connections explicit** - Turning "I feel like these are related" into "Experience A **caused** Thought B which **revealed** Desire C"
3. **Seeing patterns** - Recognizing recurring themes, cycles, growth areas
4. **Understanding motivation** - Tracing desires back to their roots (why do I want what I want?)
5. **Building wisdom** - Connecting past experiences to future intentions in ways that guide better action

**This is not therapy, but it serves a therapeutic function.** By mapping your mind's network, you gain clarity, spot blind spots, recognize growth, and understand yourself more deeply.

The architecture is built to support this meta-purpose - every design decision prioritizes **connection-making as first-class behavior**, not an afterthought.
