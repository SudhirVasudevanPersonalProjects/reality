# Story 1.1: Next.js Project Initialization & Basic Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a working Next.js app with Supabase initialized and deployed to Vercel,
**so that** I have a clean foundation to start building the phone-to-web capture system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Next.js App Created**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript runs locally
2. **Supabase Project**: Cloud Supabase project created with connection working
3. **Environment Variables**: `.env.local` configured with Supabase credentials
4. **Tailwind Configured**: Tailwind CSS installed with monochromatic dark theme
5. **Vercel Deployed**: App deployed to Vercel and accessible via URL
6. **Hello World**: Landing page shows "My Reality" heading

  - [x] Deploy and verify site is live

## Dev Notes

### Project Context (from PRD v5.0)

This is the foundation story for "My Reality" - a phone-to-web capture system where users text thoughts/photos to a number and organize them on a web dashboard.

**Epic 1 Goal**: Set up Next.js app, Supabase database, phone authentication, and Twilio SMS integration. Users can text a number and content appears on web dashboard.

### Repository Structure (from PRD)

Keep it simple - single monorepo:

```
reality/
├── app/              # Next.js application (frontend + API routes)
├── supabase/         # Database migrations, Edge Functions, RLS policies
├── docs/             # PRD, architecture, stories
└── .bmad-core/       # BMAD agent system
```

**Note**: Don't create complex monorepo with `apps/` and `packages/` - just use simple Next.js structure with `app/` at root.

### Tech Stack (from PRD Technical Assumptions)

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14+ App Router
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS (monochromatic dark/white space theme)
- Framer Motion (page transitions)
- Zustand (lightweight global state)
- TanStack Query (data fetching, caching)

**Backend:**
- Supabase PostgreSQL (database + auth + storage + realtime)
- Next.js API Routes (for `/api/chat` LLM endpoint)
- Supabase Edge Functions (for SMS webhooks)

**Deployment:**
- Frontend: Vercel (free hobby tier)
- Backend: Supabase (free tier)

**For This Story**: Only need Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Supabase basics. Other packages come later.

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJxxx...
```

### Design Theme (from PRD UI Goals)

**Space-like aesthetic:**
- Monochromatic: blacks, whites, grays
- Dark blue primary background (#1a1f2e or similar)
- Clean typography (geometric sans-serif or monospace)
- Generous whitespace
- "Looking into the void of your own mind"

### Testing

Testing not required for this initial setup story. Focus on successful build and deployment.
