# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable zero-friction thought capture via SMS (users text Reality number instantly without opening app)
- Provide spacious desktop organization interface for categorizing and visualizing captured moments
- Achieve faster iteration cycles through web deployment vs app store approval
- Reduce infrastructure costs by 73% ($35/month vs $130/month for 1K users)
- Deliver MVP in 6-8 weeks (vs 16-20 weeks for mobile equivalent)
- Prove SMS → Web workflow as superior UX for input (existing behavior) + organization (desktop interface)

## Background Context

The attention economy has turned reality into a minefield - My Reality turns it into a playfield by giving users a creator's tool to navigate it. The original mobile app approach required significant native development complexity (GPS, camera, offline sync, app store distribution) that created friction for both development and user experience.

The pivot to SMS capture + desktop web organization leverages existing user behavior (texting is frictionless) while providing the spacious interface needed for thoughtful categorization and visualization. Users text moments to their Reality number throughout the day, then organize them on desktop with Google Maps-style interface featuring interactive map, timeline, hierarchies, and Pookie (AI guide). This approach eliminates app store cycles, reduces costs, and accelerates time-to-market while delivering superior UX for both capture and organization.
