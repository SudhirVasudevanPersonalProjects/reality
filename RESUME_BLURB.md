# Reality - Personal Knowledge Management Platform

**Fullstack Web Application** | Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Vercel

• Architected and deployed fullstack content management platform with **Next.js 14 App Router**, implementing server components, API routes, and middleware for authentication, demonstrating expertise in modern React patterns and SSR/CSR optimization

• Built **PostgreSQL database schema** with Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant isolation, designed graph-based data model with typed relationships, and implemented 15+ timestamped migrations following idempotent patterns for zero-downtime deployments

• Developed **real-time data synchronization** using Supabase WebSocket subscriptions with optimistic UI updates, rollback handling, and auto-generated TypeScript types from database schema ensuring end-to-end type safety

• Engineered custom **2D spatial visualization engine** using HTML5 Canvas with hexagonal lattice positioning algorithm, Perlin noise procedural generation, quad-tree spatial indexing for hit detection, and requestAnimationFrame loop achieving 60 FPS with 1000+ rendered items

• Implemented **ML-based content recommendation system** using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity scoring, with plans for embeddings-based semantic search using OpenAI API integration

• Built **mobile-first capture interface** with geolocation API integration, multi-file upload to Supabase Storage, client-side OCR using Tesseract.js, and Open Graph/Twitter Card metadata extraction for link previews

• Designed **swipeable batch processing UI** with touch gesture support (momentum scrolling, snap points), CSS transform animations, and React state management for rapid content categorization workflow

• Established comprehensive **testing infrastructure** with Vitest and React Testing Library achieving 80%+ code coverage across unit, integration, and component tests, plus ESLint/TypeScript strict mode for code quality

• Configured **CI/CD pipeline** with Vercel auto-deployments from GitHub, environment variable management, and preview deployments for pull requests, maintaining 95+ Lighthouse scores across all metrics

• Applied **modern development practices**: TypeScript strict mode, Zod schema validation, custom React hooks, server/client component separation, API route handlers with proper error handling, and BMAD agile workflow with automated quality gates
